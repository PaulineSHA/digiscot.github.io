### Project description

This is a partnership bid with Glasgow Life/Glasgow Libraries, Glasgow Homelessness Network, Nan McKay Memorial Hall, Govan and Craigton Integration Network and Glasgow Clyde College. Southside Housing Association is the lead partner. The project will take place within the Pollokshields and Cardonald/Craigton areas of Glasgow. The project broadly aims to support people currently not digitally engaged but who would benefit greatly.

Key elements of the project include:

* Installation of wi-fi and IT equipment within 4 community bases; providing local, safe and welcoming environments for learning. The bases are community flats (or resident lounge within sheltered housing complexes) converted into common space for local people to come together and participate in positive activities. Current activities include easy exercise, story telling, arts, and healthy cooking. By providing wi-fi and IT equipment we will be able to extend these activities to include digital learning. It should be noted that we have 3 other community bases with wi-fi, and we work in close partnership with the Nan McKay Memorial Hall as a welcoming base for learning. These spaces will be used within the project, however in order to reach the target groups outlined above, and a greater number of individuals, this project requires additional support in the form of further wi-fi installation, IT equipment and in-kind support from partners.

* Delivery of a range of courses (by Glasgow Clyde College) within each community base covering the [basic digital skills](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/participation/basic-digital-skills/). By doing so we hope to provide people with the skills to improve their ability to connect with others, save money on-line, enquire and apply for benefits, carry out research and work together to improve, develop and connect within their local areas. We also envisage that by providing wi-fi people may choose to bring their own IT equipment to the bases at a time that suits them (outwith the structured learning/activity times).
We have completed the delivery of 3 courses, 2 in our Sheltered Housing bases in Pollokshields and one within our Berryknowes Base in Cardonald.  7 people attended each programme, all 21 attendees were taught the basics in using tablets, setting up thier own email accounts, send and recieve emails and searching online.  Some participants brought thier own laptops or tablets and used thier own equipment to build thier confindence and existing skills.  We will be running another 2 courses ove rthe summer.
* Ensuring that people are not simply offered the opportunity of participating in digital learning and using wi-fi in their own time (within the bases), but that they are encouraged to connect with existing services and organisations, thus using the project as a foundation for creating pathways to these services and therefore greater outcomes for participants. These other services are currently offered within local libraries, Glasgow Clyde College, the Nan McKay Memorial Hall, Glasgow Homelessness Network and the Govan and Craigton Integration Network. We recognise the importance of ensuring people know what other support exists, which is why this project will be delivered in partnership.
Each course incorporated a workshop delivered by Glasgow Libraries where all attendees were informed of the various services the library has to offer.  All attendees were given the opportunity to referr themselves to the Glasgow Libraries IT workshops to continue thier learning and utilise other services relevant to theier needs.  Southside Hosuing Association (SHA) also purchased and dontated IT equipment to other local services.  We dontated a Smart Board to the Glasgow and Craigton Integration Network (GCIN) to support them in delivering a series of Esol and IT workshops.  We also donated a number of Tablets to he Nan Makcay Hall to support them in delivering a similar series of Digital learning workshops.
By delivering this project we hope to address some of the barriers people find to going online. Some of which include ‘it’s too difficult to learn’; ‘it’s too expensive’; ‘worrying about privacy/viruses; ‘no connection/computer’ (CarnegieUK Trust, 2013. Across the Divide –Tackling Digital Exclusion in Glasgow).
Prioir to running these courses, Southside Housing Association coordinated a series of consultation meetings within each base and also distributed a feedback questionnaire to all tenants living local to our bases.  The consultations and finiding of the questionnaire revealed that a significantly high number of tenants were keen to take part in Digital Learning course but felt they were "too old now" or "its too hard to learn that stuff".  WE also found that many tenants did not have the finances to install wifi in thier homes and purchase equipment of thier own.  THe local bases provide a safe and free space to learn and break down some of these barriers.  At the beginning of each course we asked attendees to complete a Digityal inclusion questionnare, this captured thier current skill level and attitudes.  We also asked all attendees to complete the questionnaire after the course had completed.  We found that all attendees had learned a new skill and most were farily confident in sending and recieveing emails on their own.  We observed a change in attitude, particualry amongst older participants who previousy believed they were too old to particiapte.  It is good to note that 6 of our older participants now attend the library once a week, use the computer thier and also utilise other services the libaray has to offer.
### Planned project milestones

* Installation of Wi-Fi within 4 community bases: December 2015
Wifi has been installed in all 8 of ou community bases.  All tenants and members of the local community are encourages to use the space to continue thier learning and take part in all the other servies ans activities the bases have to offer.
* IT equipment purchased and ready for use. This will include: tablets, keyboards for tablets, mice, tablet covers, smart screen, memory sticks and adapters, laptops, paper and printer): December 2015
We purchased 26 tablets for Southside Housing Association to use within our course delivery, 1 Smart Board and 5 Chrome Books for Glasgow and Craigton Integration Networkk and 10 tablets for the Nan Mackay Hall.
* A range of learning programmes for communities developed in partnership with Glasgow Clyde College and Glasgow Life (library services), Nan McKay Memorial Hall, Glasgow Homelessness Network and Govan and Craigton Integration Network: January 2015

* 14 Learning programmes promoted and delivered to communities: October 2016
Currently Southside Housing Association have delivered 3 digital Inclusion Programmes.  The Glasgoe and Craigton Integration Network deliver 6 Esol courses and 2 weekly Homework Clubs for younger children using the Smart Board.  Nan Mackay deliver 2 Digital Inclusion classes per week.  SHA will run 2 more courses over the summer, THe ESOl calsses run by GCIN and Digital Classes run by Nan Mackay are continous programme of learning.
TEST
* Community bases utilised informally/ad-hoc by local people: October 2016
All our community bases are used by tenants and members of the local community, 5 Coffee afternoons and one Arts and Crafts workshop, one Knitting Club, throughout our bases, are self run by participants.  local residents are also offered the space for personal use, such as parties,lage gathering wiht friends and family.
### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Participants are more equipped, confident and able to use their digital skills to carry out and manage day-to-day activities (e.g. on-line shopping, in touch with family, on-line forums/support, resolving benefit/welfare issues).
Following on from the Digital Inclusion programme, we are now encouraging residents to contact staff via email as well as by telephone.  We also encourage residents to bring thier IT equipment to the bases to utilise the wifi space.
* Participants have improved skills and abilities, and increased knowledge and understanding of how to improve their employment and financial opportunities through IT and internet sources.

* Participants have an increased awareness of and connectedness to existing community services and resources.

* Participants are more connected to others in their community, and are motivated to work together to improve their local area/community, using IT/digital methods as a means to supporting this process.

### Evaluation
We held a review meetings after the inital 3 courses and were pleased with the results we had achieved.  We were also please with the extent to which we supported other agencies to engage people digitally.  We hoped to engage a high number of participants and agreed to actively promote the next two course on a wider level, reaching out to local community centres, the local church and promting the coursed via more local services.

### Lessons learned
After the intial 3 course were completed, we held a review meeting with all stakeholders involved to evaluate our delivery and make reccommendations for the next two classes.  We agreed that we would incorporate and induction session prioir to the next two courses, the people who were beginners would be placed on the Digital Inclusion programme deliverd by SHA and those who had a basic skill level would be referred to Glasgow Libraies.  We all agreed this format as we found that the original 3 courses were somewhat disjointed due to the various skill levels of participants.  Some particiapnts, with no skill level required one one one learning and others needed less support.  Thus, we agreed that we would group the skill levels together.
